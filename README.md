# Weather App
Weather App - Frontend App 

## Summary

The objective of this project was to refine my skills in frontend development and learn how to work with APIs effectively.

I created a straightforward and intuitive weather application designed to offer users immediate access to weather information. Users can quickly obtain weather details either by entering a city name or by using their current location.

The application was developed with web technologies, leveraging HTML for its foundational structure, Bootstrap for a mobile-responsive layout, JavaScript for adding dynamic functionalities, jQuery for simplified DOM manipulations, and Axios for efficient HTTP requests to interact with external APIs.

For accurate weather data, this app utilizes two primary APIs: the Weather API for fetching detailed weather conditions and the IPGeolocation API to determine the user's current location for location-based weather reporting.
